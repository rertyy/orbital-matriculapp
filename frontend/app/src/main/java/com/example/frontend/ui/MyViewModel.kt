// a viewmodel exposes state to the UI and encapsulates related business logic.
// Its principal advantage is that it caches state and persists it through configuration changes.
// This means that your UI doesn't have to fetch data again when navigating between activities,
// or following configuration changes, such as when rotating the screen.
